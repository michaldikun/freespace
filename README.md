FreeSpace
FreeSpace is a Bash script that allows you to compress files and directories, freeing up disk space. It provides options for recursive compression and setting a timeout for deleting compressed files.

Usage
freespace [-r] [-t ###] file [file...]
Options
-r: Enables recursive compression. If this flag is set, the script will compress all files and subdirectories within a directory.
-t ###: Sets the timeout in hours. After the specified timeout, compressed files will be deleted. The default timeout is 48 hours.
Functions
is_file_zipped
Checks if a file is already compressed. If it is, and it meets the timeout condition, the file will be deleted.

zip_directory_without_recursive
Compresses files in a directory without recursively compressing subdirectories.

zip_directory_with_recursive
Recursively compresses files in a directory, including all subdirectories.

zip_file
Compresses a single file. If the file is already compressed, it will be renamed with the prefix "fc-" and a timestamp.

start_zipping
Determines whether to perform recursive or non-recursive compression based on the options provided. It calls the appropriate functions accordingly.

Example Usage
Compress a single file:

freespace myfile.txt
Compress a directory without recursion:

freespace -r mydirectory/
Compress a directory with recursion:

freespace -t 24 -r mydirectory/
Note
Please note that this script permanently deletes files after the specified timeout. Use it with caution and ensure you have proper backups in place.
